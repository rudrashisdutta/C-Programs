###### Question1: [```Answer1```](1.c)
    ✨ Write a program to search an element x in an array of n integers using binary search algorithm that uses divide and conquer technique.  
        Find out the best case, worst case and average case time complexities for different values of n and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.  
        The n integers can be generated randomly and x can be chosen randomly, or any element of the array or middle or last element of the array depending on type of time complexity analysis.
###### Question2: [```Answer2```](2.c)
    ✨Write a program to sort a list of n elements using the merge sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements.  
        Repeat the experiment for different values of n and different nature of data (random data, sorted data, reversely sorted data) in the list.  
        n is the user input and n integers can be generated randomly.  
        Finally plot a graph of the time taken versus n.
