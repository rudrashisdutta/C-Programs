###### Question1: [```Answer1```](1.c)
    ✨ Write a program to store numbers into an array of n integers and then find out the smallest and largest number stored in it. n is the user input.
###### Question2: [```Answer2```](2.c)
    ✨Write a program to store numbers into an array of n integers, where the array must cotains some duplicates. Do the following:  
         a) Find out the total number of duplicate elements.  
         b) Find out the most repeating element in the array.
###### Question3: [```Answer3```](3.c)
    ✨Write a program to rearrange the elements of an array of n integers such that all even numbers are followed by all odd numbers.  
       How many different ways you can solve this problem. 
       Write your approaches & strategy for solving this problem.
###### Question4: [```Answer4```](4.c)
    ✨Write a program that takes three variable (a, b, c) as separate parameters and rotates the values stored so that value a goes to be, b, b to c and c to a by using SWAP(x,y) function that swaps/exchanges the numbers x & y.
###### Question5: [```Answer5```](5.c)
    ✨Let A be n*n square matrix array. WAP by using appropriate user defined functions for the following:  
         a) Find the number of nonzero elements in A  
         b) Find the sum of the elements above the leading diagonal.  
         c) Display the elements below the minor diagonal.  
         d) Find the product of the diagonal elements.
###### Question6: [```Answer6```](6.c)
    ✨Write a program for finding i and j in an array A for any key such that A[j]^2 + A[i]^2 == key
###### Question7: [```Answer7```](7.c)
    ✨Given key in a sorted array A with distinct values. Write a program to find i, j, k such that A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == key.
###### Question8: [```Answer8```](8.c)
    ✨Suppose an array A has n distinct integers. Increasing sequence is given as A[1].........A[k] and decreasing sequence is given as A[k+1]........A[n]..
