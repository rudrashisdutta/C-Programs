###### Question1: [```Answer1```](1.c)
    ✨ Compare the best case, worst case and average case time complexity of Insertion Sort on basis of Step Count Method as well as CPU clock time.
###### Question2: [```Answer2```](2.c)
    ✨Let A be a list of n (not necessarily distinct) integers. Write a program by using User Defined Function(UDF)s to test whether any item occurs more than ⌈ n/2⌉ times in A.  
        a) UDF should take O(n^2) time and use no additional space.
        b) UDF should take O(n) time and use O(1) additional space.
###### Question3: [```Answer3```](3.c)
    ✨Write a program by using an user defined function for computing ⌊ √n⌋ for any positive integer n. Besides assignment and comparison, your algorithm may only use the four basic arithmetical operations.
